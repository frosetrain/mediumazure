That plan that we instantly decided on: have 2 rows, one that can fit 3 park elements, and another that can fit 2/3 starter kits.

Prioritise park elements and starter kits. Do e-bikes if there is time. Putting the starter kit inside the house is optional. Omit the cable. This means we are aiming for a maximum of 101 points.

Starter kits may not fit together well. When dragged along the mat in the mechanism, it might not be optimal. However, taking one kit at a time is also not optimal. I wonder if the same space could be used for both park elements and starter kits.

Actually going back to the left edge to grab a new starter kit using a stick would not be super slow.

Wait that could actually work. So if the starter kits don't fit together, I should just make a mechanism that is a door for the park elements, and also has a stick to grab 1 starter kit.

Time to build a small bot with 1 stick for side quest 4. And we don't have the parts. Gotta improvise.
